# Excersise 1

## Task 1

Check out [this Postman collection](./task1.json).

## Task 2

a) Yes
b) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
c) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
d) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
e) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
f) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
g) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
h) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
i) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 
j) No, it doesn't have key-value-pairs 

Note: This was to simple. Check definition RCF!

## Task 3

a) It uses ES256 which means the signature is calculated using ECDSA with a P-256 curve and SHA256 hashing algorithm. 
b) No, because the signature verification is calculated over the header and payload. Changing any value within the JWT would invalidate the signature. Ignoring the GID parameter doesn't mean that the cryptographically algorithm can be skipped. 

## Task 4

a) The JWT encodes the private RSA parameters within its header. 
b) ?
